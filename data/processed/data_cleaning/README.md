## Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

This folder documents the data cleaning and preprocessing stage of the project.

Key processes performed:
- Integration of multiple transactional tables
- Data type correction and validation
- Revenue recalculation (Price × Quantity × (1 − Discount))
- Outlier assessment and validation as business behavior
- Feature engineering for analytical readiness

Large intermediate datasets generated during this process are not included
due to file size considerations.

All preprocessing logic is fully documented and reproducible through the
notebooks provided in this repository.
